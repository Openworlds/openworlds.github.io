Welcome to OpenWorlds, an opensource 3D universe architecture, built using Web and mobile technologies, so you can visit it from anywhere, any device, anywhere with an internet connection, ofcourse.

The project is just starting up, so any and all help is appreciated. If you have any ideas, drop us a line, or use our github.com organisation resources instead.

You can find us at: [github.com/openworlds](https://github.com/openworlds)
